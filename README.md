# XKCDâ€”Click and Drag

![Click and Drag starting point](./entry-point.png)

This repository contains the complete image of the "Click and Drag" comic by XKCD. You can view the original comic [here](https://xkcd.com/1110/).

The repository includes the following files:

- [images/tiles](./images/tiles): The individual tiles as they appear on the XKCD website.
- [images/rows](./images/rows): Five files, each representing another part of the full comic.

Additionally,
you can get the full comic by using the file `xkcd-click-and-drag.png`.
Please be patient, as it is a large file!

For those who use Gimp,
you can open the file that combines all the rows by clicking
`xkcd-click-and-drag.xcf`.
Note that this file requires approximately 43GB of memory.

Enjoy ðŸŽ‰
