The repository includes the following files:

- [images/tiles](./images/tiles): The individual tiles as they appear on the XKCD website.
- [images/rows](./images/rows): Five files, each representing another part of the full comic.
- [xkcd-click-and-drag.png](./xkcd-click-and-drag.png): The full comic in high resolution.
- [xkcd-click-and-drag.xcf](./xkcd-click-and-drag.xcf): The Gimp file that combines all the rows. Be aware that this file requires approximately 43GB of memory to open.

All the source code used to fetch and combine the images is available in the [src](./src) directory.
